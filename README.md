Identifying DACs based on state definitions

The EPA Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) requires states to allocate a certain percentage of their state funds to Disadvantaged Communities (DACs). Each state, however, may define DACs themeselves, which has resulted in each state having a different definition of a DAC. This project aims to see whether DACs can be identified in each state given state definitions and the data available. For example, California defines DACs based on the Median Household Income (MHI) for the community, and then further categorizes DACs based on system size, by number of service connections OR population served. As such, we attempt to use ACS data (which California uses to calculate state MHI)
